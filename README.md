# 3D-Developer-Portfolio-2.0
Welcome to the 3D-Developer-Portfolio project! This is a simple website designed to showcase a developer's portfolio using 3D graphics. The project is built using Vite, Three js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, making it a powerful and flexible tool for creating stunning visuals.

In addition to its core technologies, this project also utilizes higher-order components (HOC) to simplify and streamline the development process. Furthermore, we've included email js to make it easy for visitors to contact the developer directly from the website.
